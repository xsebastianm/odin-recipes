    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flour:</strong> All-purpose flour adds structure to the banana muffin batter.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaveners:</strong>Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the muffins rise.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Bananas:</strong>Of course, you'll need mashed bananas!</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>White sugar sweetens things up a bit.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong>An egg binds the muffin batter together and lends moisture.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong>Melted butter adds even more moisture and richness.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make banana muffins from scratch</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade banana muffins:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift the dry ingredients together in one bowl. Mix the wet ingredients in another bowl.</li>
        <li>Fold the dry mixture into the wet mixture.</li>
        <li>Spoon the batter into prepared muffin tins. Bake the muffins in the preheated oven.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How long to bake banana muffins</h2>
    <p>In an oven preheated to 350 degrees F, a dozen banana muffins should be fully baked in 25 to 30 minutes. You'll know they're done when the top springs back when lightly pressed.
        If you make mini muffins, decrease the baking time to 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
